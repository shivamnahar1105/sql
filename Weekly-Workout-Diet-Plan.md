## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MUSCLE GAIN

### Workout Optimization
1. ✅ Focus on progressive overload—gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week
2. ✅ Maintain 8-12 rep range for most working sets to maximize hypertrophy
3. ✅ Ensure proper form and full range of motion on all exercises
4. ✅ Rest 60-90 seconds between sets for compound lifts, 45-60 for isolations
5. ✅ Keep cardio to 3-4 sessions per week at low-to-moderate intensity to preserve gains
6. ✅ Consider adding an extra rest day if experiencing excessive fatigue or CNS burnout
7. ✅ Use Sunday rest day for active recovery—light stretching or yoga
8. ✅ Track workouts and aim for small strength improvements week-to-week

### Nutrition Optimization
1. ✅ Track macros consistently using an app (MyFitnessPal, FatSecret) for accuracy
2. ✅ Ensure you hit 1.6-2.2g protein per kg of body weight daily (more on plant-based)
3. ✅ Space protein intake evenly (20-30g per meal) to maximize muscle protein synthesis
4. ✅ Consume majority of carbs around workout times (pre and post)
5. ✅ Continue multivitamin to cover plant-based diet gaps (B12, Iron, Zinc, Vitamin D)
6. ✅ Stay hydrated—drink 3-4L water daily, more on training days
7. ✅ Vary your protein sources throughout the day (dals, legumes, protein powder, quinoa)
8. ✅ Eat in a slight caloric surplus (+200-400 calories above maintenance) for optimal growth
9. ✅ Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep nightly for recovery and hormone optimization
10. ✅ Adjust portions if progress stalls—increase protein or carbs slightly

### Recovery & Consistency
- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night is critical for muscle growth and hormone levels
- **Consistency:** Follow the plan for at least 8-12 weeks before evaluating results
- **Flexibility:** If an option doesn't sit well or you dislike the food, swap with another option
- **Progress Tracking:** Take photos, measurements, and strength records weekly
- **Patience:** Muscle gain takes time; expect 0.25-0.5kg gain per week on a plant-based diet
